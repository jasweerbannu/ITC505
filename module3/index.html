                <h4>Project: 2</h4>
                <p>I made a simple HTML webpage and put it live on four different servers: Netlify, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a local Node.js server. This gave me the opportunity to evaluate and contrast each platform's deployment procedures, general user experience, and performance. I learned a great deal about web hosting technologies and the subtleties of deploying web apps in various contexts from this experience. Through this project, I was able to hone my technical abilities while also expanding my knowledge of web hosting and deployment techniques, which will be very helpful for future work.
