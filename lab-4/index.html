            <h2>Addendum:</h2>
		<p>I made the few changes to my lab-2 assignment by adding the CSS to look good and enhance the readability. Here are the chocies which I took for this assignment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly Font choice, i choose Arial as main and sans-serif as fallbacks ensure readability across different platforms, These usally provide the cross platform readability and clarity</li>
		<li>Secondly heading, for heading I used the tags like title, h1, h2 because they are larger heading tags in html and provide the hierarchial apperance, consistency for readbility and looks uniformly.</li>
		<li>Thirdly color choice, for color I used the dark hearder(black) with light body(white) to maintain the contrast between the text in the body and background.</li>
		<li>Then Margin, for the body I provided the 20px margin, in hearder I provided the 5px margin above the email, for main section I provided the 20px margin at top and bottom to looks like they are seperate</li>
		<li>Finally padding, for the header I provided the 10px padding, for main section I provided the 20px and for footer I also I provided the 10px padding to provide the spacing between the elements.</li>
